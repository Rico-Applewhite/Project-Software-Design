# Project-Software-Design

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
    The Client's "The Gameing Room" has tasks us with creating a web-based game application of their game "Draw it or Lose It" that must be able to run on multiple operating platforms.
    
    
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
    Createing the UML class diagram for design document was helpful when developing the code. It gave me an outline of the classes aand how they should interact with each other.
    
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    If could improve any part of the document, I would add a little more details to the Evaluation section. With a little more research  I can go further in depth about the server and client sides of each operating plateform.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    User's needs are improtant because they will be the primary user of the software. In this software the experience had to be tailored to handleing multiple users and on diffrent platforms. The stablity of the software and it's runniabllity should ensure that every player is haveing the same experience.
    
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
