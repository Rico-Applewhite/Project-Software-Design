# Project-Software-Design

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
    The Client's "The Gaming Room" has tasked us with creating a web-based game application of their game "Draw it or Lose It" that must be able to run on multiple operating platforms.
    
    
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
    I believe I was successful in showing the difference between what operating platform and evaluating which would be more efficient for developing the software for this game.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
    Creating the UML class diagram for the design document was helpful when developing the code. It gave me an outline of the classes and how they should interact with each other.
    
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    If could improve any part of the document, I would add a little more details to the Evaluation section. With a little more research  I can go further in-depth about the server and client sides of each operating platform.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    User's needs are important because they will be the primary user of the software. In this software, the experience had to be tailored to handle multiple users and on different platforms. The stability of the software and its runabilty should ensure that every player is having the same experience.
    
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
    I approach designing the software by first listening to the client's needs, before thinking of a way to enhance the user's experiences. Creating a Software design document, even if it is not required, would be a good technique for future projects. Will have a written outline of the project and the document may help others understand the project better.
